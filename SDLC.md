# Software Development Life Cycle - SDLC

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software. in detail, the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phases of software development:

####The SDLC involves six phases:

- Requirement analysis
- Planning
- Software design such as architectural design
- Software development
- Testing
- Deployment

Popular SDLC models include the **waterfall model**, **spiral model**, and **Agile** model.

### What is the software development life cycle?
**SDLC** or the Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time possible. SDLC provides a well-structured flow of phases that help an organization to quickly produce high-quality software which is well-tested and ready for production use.

### SDLC goal
Lowering the cost of software development while simultaneously improving quality and shortening production time.

SDLC achieves these goals by following a plan that removes the typical pitfalls of software development projects. 

- Evaluate existing systems for deficiencies
- Define the requirements of the new system
- Сreate the software through the stages of analysis, planning, design, development, testing, and deployment.

By anticipating costly mistakes like failing to ask the end-user or client for feedback, SLDC can eliminate redundant rework and after-the-fact fixes.

It’s also important to know that there is a strong focus on the testing phase. As the SDLC is a repetitive methodology, you have to ensure code quality at every cycle.


## Stages (Phases) and Best Practices

- Phase 1: Requirement collection and analysis
- Phase 2: Planing
- Phase 3: Design
- Phase 4: Coding
- Phase 5: Testing
- Phase 6: Deployment  
- Phase 7: Maintenance

APM - Application performance monitoring (APM) tools can be used in a development, QA, and production environment. This keeps everyone using the same toolset across the entire development lifecycle.

### Phase 1: Requirement collection and analysis:
he requirement is the first stage in the SDLC process. It is conducted by the senior team members with inputs from all the stakeholders and domain experts in the industry. Planning for the quality assurance requirements and recognization of the risks involved is also done at this stage.

This stage gives a clearer picture of the scope of the entire project and the anticipated issues, opportunities, and directives which triggered the project.

Requirements Gathering stage need teams to get detailed and precise requirements. This helps companies to finalize the necessary timeline to finish the work of that system.

### Phase 2: Planing (Feasibility study):
Once the requirement analysis phase is completed the next sdlc step is to define and document software needs. This process conducted with the help of 'Software Requirement Specification' document also known as 'SRS' document. It includes everything which should be designed and developed during the project life cycle.

##### There are mainly five types of feasibilities checks:
- Economic: Can we complete the project within the budget or not?  
- Legal: Can we handle this project as cyber law and other regulatory framework/compliances.  
- Operation feasibility: Can we create operations which is expected by the client?  
- Technical: Need to check whether the current computer system can support the software  
- Schedule: Decide that the project can be completed within the given schedule or not.   

### Phase 3: Design:
In this third phase, the system and software design documents are prepared as per the requirement specification document. This helps define overall system architecture.

#### High-Level Design (HLD)
- Brief description and name of each module  
- An outline about the functionality of every module  
- Interface relationship and dependencies between modules  
- Database tables identified along with their key elements  
- Complete architecture diagrams along with technology details  

#### Low-Level Design(LLD)
- Functional logic of the modules
- Database tables, which include type and size
- Complete detail of the interface
- Addresses all types of dependency issues
- Listing of error messages
- Complete input and outputs for every module

### Phase 4: Coding:
Once the system design phase is over, the next phase is coding. In this phase, developers start build the entire system by writing code using the chosen programming language. In the coding phase, tasks are divided into units or modules and assigned to the various developers. It is the longest phase of the Software Development Life Cycle process.

In this phase, Developer needs to follow certain predefined coding guidelines. They also need to use programming tools like compiler, interpreters, debugger to generate and implement the code.

### Phase 5: Testing:
Once the software is complete, and it is deployed in the testing environment. The testing team starts testing the functionality of the entire system. This is done to verify that the entire application works according to the customer requirement.


### Phase 6: Installation/Deployment:
Once the software testing phase is over and no bugs or errors left in the system then the final deployment process starts. Based on the feedback given by the project manager, the final software is released and checked for deployment issues if any.


### Phase 7: Maintenance:
Once the system is deployed, and customers start using the developed system, following 3 activities occur
- Bug fixing - bugs are reported because of some scenarios which are not tested at all   
- Upgrade - Upgrading the application to the newer versions of the Software   
- Enhancement - Adding some new features into the existing software   

The main focus of this SDLC phase is to ensure that needs continue to be met and that the system continues to perform as per the specification mentioned in the first phase.






# The most common SDLC models:

---
- Waterfall
- **Agile**
- Iterative
- V-shaped
- Big Bang
- Spiral  

### Waterfall model in SDLC
The waterfall is a widely accepted SDLC model. In this approach, the whole process of the software development is divided into various phases of SDLC. In this SDLC model, the outcome of one phase acts as the input for the next phase.

This SDLC model is documentation-intensive, with earlier phases documenting what need be performed in the subsequent phases.



### Incremental Model  
The incremental model is not a separate model. It is essentially a series of waterfall cycles. The requirements are divided into groups at the start of the project. For each group, the SDLC model is followed to develop software. The SDLC process is repeated, with each release adding more functionality until all requirements are met. In this method, every cycle act as the maintenance phase for the previous software release. Modification to the incremental model allows development cycles to overlap. After that subsequent cycle may begin before the previous cycle is complete.


### V-Model  
In this type of SDLC model testing and the development, the phase is planned in parallel. So, there are verification phases of sdlc on the side and the validation phase on the other side. V-Model joins by Coding phase.

### Agile Model  
Agile methodology is a practice which promotes continue interaction of development and testing during the SDLC process of any project. In the Agile method, the entire project is divided into small incremental builds. All of these builds are provided in iterations, and each iteration lasts from one to three weeks.



## Benefits of the SDLC

---
SDLC done right can allow the highest level of management control and documentation. Developers understand what they should build and why. All parties agree on the goal upfront and see a clear plan for arriving at that goal. Everyone understands the costs and resources required.


## Conclusion
