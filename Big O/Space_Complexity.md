# Space Complexity

> Space Complexity - is a reference to how much ram or memory or space an algorithm needs to complete a given task.

>Space Complexity and Time Complexity are not always would be identical.

## O(N)
***String reversal***  
Each letter using space, so we should allocate n amount of space to string with length of n letters

## O(N^2)
***Steps algorithm***  
step(2) 2 * 2 produce 4 elements, thereof we need to allocate space for 4 elements.
step(4) 4 * 4 produce 16 elements
