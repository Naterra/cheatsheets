#### Stable Sorting Algorithm
A stable sorting algorithm is an algorithm that won’t change the relative order of items in a list that have the same value. 

#### Unstable Algorithm
The original order of elements is not preserved. As an example this would mean that if you placed multiple 5’s in an array, there’s no way to guarantee that the 5’s will all be in the same order that you placed them in the array after it’s been sorted, as shown here.
